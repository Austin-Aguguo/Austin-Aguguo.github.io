<p style="color:white">Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams.</p>
<style>
        p {

    </style>
<p style="color:white">Once upon a time! Players met at an agreed location, and on a specified date, to enjoy gaming. Today, players can coordinate and enjoy competitive and collaborative video-gaming from the comfort of their sofas.</p>
<p style="color:white">I played a lot of games growing up. Most of my friends were people who played games as well. We have a lot of hidden talents in this country. Unfortunately, games are simply seen as leisure stuff or even not taken seriously by the general public. My dream is for Nigerian children to come together and build a fun, competitive and profitable e-sports community that will rival that of Western and Asian countries.

<p style="color:white">Kyle Giersdorf, a 16-year-old video-game player, won <b style="color:white">$3 million</b> after winning the first-ever Fortnite World Cup</p>
<p style="color:white">In 2021, the global eSports market was valued at just <b style="color:white">over 1.08 billion U.S. dollars</b>, an almost 50 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
<p style="color:white">In the UK, the esports sector supported <b style="color:white">£111.5 million</b> in Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2020. A major global esports event was calculated to generate 238 full-time equivalents (FTEs) of employment and £12million in GVA for the UK economy.</p>
<p style="color:white">It is clear that e-sports is very beneficial to the economy. It is a great source of revenue when done right. The e-sports community in Nigeria has a very good opportunity to generate wealth, create employment opportunities and a good source of fun and enjoyment all at once!</p>

<p style="color:white">One may think gaming is just a waste of time or a way to have fun. However, games helped me a lot while growing up. They helped me in decision making, they helped to lighten up my mood, and they even helped me in <b style="color:white">EXAMS!</b> lol. Here are a couple of ways gaming is important to children:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:white">Reading skills are developed as game rules and instructions are deciphered.</li>
<li style="color:white">Strategy and logic are employed in some games. Even when playing checkers children can develop future-thinking, problem-solving, and reasoning skills by looking at upcoming move options.</li>
<li style="color:white">Creative skills can be developed, especially with games involving drawing pictures or acting out a word or scene.</li>
<li style="color:white">Throughout life math, reading, writing, negotiating, managing resources and time, following rules, and cooperating with others is vital. Games played with family and friends can help build these skills from a very young age.</li>
